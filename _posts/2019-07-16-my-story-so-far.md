A friend of mine invited me to speak at a meeting I've attended a couple of times. He failed to tell me that I would be speaking for 25 minutes until I already committed, which definitely made me a little nervous. I decided that I can't wing it for 25 minutes, so this blog is both to tell my story and serve as my outline on Sunday. I'll provide the audio sometime next week.

On the outside, I was a high functioning person. Most people had no idea how much I drank and even those who did, wouldn't have thought of me as an alcoholic. But the truth of the matter is that I was completely miserable inside. I wasn't able to sit with myself alone. I needed to escape. Recovery has given me the tools to figure out why that is and to change my narrative.

# Growing Up
## An Alcoholic Home
My early childhood was in an abusive, alcoholic unstable home. My Dad got out of the military after 20 years and had a really hard time coping with civilian life. The reality that no one cared he was a vet and even fewer cared what rank he was devastated him. So he turned to drinking. 

He would take me to daycare in the morning and go back home to sleep, while my Mom went to work. When he picked me up from daycare, we'd go back home and he would proceed to get drunk and shout at my Mom all night, preventing either of us from getting much sleep.

The stress from having to work full time without being able to sleep caused my Mom to get Fibromyalagia and Epstein-Barr Syndrome, diseases characterized by chronic pain, that made it very difficult for her to function.

After a couple of years of abuse from my Dad, my Mom finally moved out of the home with me to get us out of that situation. After a couple attempts at reconciliation, it was clear my Dad wasn't going to change, so they got divorced.

During the divorce, my Dad did everything he could to make it as difficult on my Mom as possible. Leaving her without a car and with $40,000+ in legal fees from the divorce. The result was that we lived a very insecure life - constantly struggling with finances.

## Constant Stress

Growing up, we spent a lot of time in church. A **Fundamentalist Christian** church in National City, CA called New Covenant Tabernacle. While a lot of churches focused on applying the Bible to your life to live a better, happier life, New Covenant focused on the hell, fire and brimstone aspects of Christianity.

They motivated by fear. And tended to attract the bottom-feeders of society - hurting, broken people who were looking for relief. And that was it for my Mom. Even though the church caused more problems than it solved in my life, it was a lifeline for my Mom. 

Because I was only at church alternating weekends due to my parents' child custody arrangement, I did not fit in with the other kids at church. Not fitting in, coupled with super long services, made it a pretty unpleasant place for me to be. 

And yet, the fear go to me. I was not yet aware of my sexuality at this point, but I still felt like this broken person who needed to be saved by God. Every service there was an alter-call, in order to accept god into your life. And every week I went up for that, wanting to feel this relief that so many of the fundamentalists seemed to have in their life, but I never did. 

Not fitting in, coupled with not feeling the internal euphoria that the other church members claimed to have, made me feel more broken than ever. Like something was wrong with me, rather than with fundamentalist religion.

> I now see this type of religion as tantamount to child abuse. But, on the other hand, it probably kept my Mom alive. Whatever it was that I sought, but never found, she definitely seemed to have. A sense of relief, a reliance on a higher power that she could unload her problems on.

## And then came puberty
And then came puberty. I was in 5th grade. I began to discover how my body worked. And it felt good. Over time, this led to discussions with friends about this amazing new thing I had discovered. Many of them had discovered it too and were as enthusiastic as I was about it. 

We began to think about sex. And a couple of the guys I hung out with would sneak pictures to school from their Dad's playboy magazines. We would look at these pictures in the bathroom in awe. Except, while they were looking at the women, I found myself looking at the men.

This is when I began to realize that I was interested in men. I didn't even have a word for these feelings, but I knew it was wrong. At least according to my religious programming. I should not have these feelings. I should not be lusting over anyone, but especially not men.

Trying to avoid these feelings just made me feel them more. I kept this secret to myself. I didn't even tell my best friend. I just played along when they would talk about images of women.

# Middle School
## Marching Band
In Middle School, I got involved in Marching Band. This was the first time in my educational career where I was in a class with people older than me, some of whom identified as gay or bi. 

Of course, my religious programming caused me to avoid these people, but I think part of me still respected them for being out when I was so deeply in the closet.

## Playing with the idea of coming out
By 8th grade, I had told my cousin about my feelings about men. She told me that she, too, was interested in the same sex. We both went to the same church, so we had a similar guilt/shame regarding what we felt. But we were able to take some comfort in being able to share that with each other, at least.

At some point during this year, she got outed to her parents, who punished her harshly for it. So, to help herself, naturally she outed me and threw me under the bus too. I vividly remember this night, we went over to her house and had a come-to-god discussion.

I was able to dodge accusation and get my Mom off my back for a few more years, but at this point Beth was out and proud, consequences be damned. 

## A Dark Place

Being closeted, resenting church and having a very strained relationship with my loose-cannon-of-a-Dad took its toll on me. Despite not wanting to go to my Dad's, he had joint custody, so I spent every other weekend with him. During this time, he largely ignored me and watched sports of Fox News all day.

This was in the early days of the internet, when people still had dial up internet and text based RPGs were a thing. To escape my reality, I spent a lot of time on the computer. Talking to other people like me, who were in a dark place themselves. We used to listen to EMO music and talk about our feelings.

This is where I discovered LiveJournal, an early form of blog. I wrote everything in my LiveJournal. Every feeling I had, no matter how dark. Issues with teachers, issues with students, my own feelings in inadequacy and self-loathing. In a way I think it was a cry for help. And, as such, I wasn't very discreet about it. 

## The turning point
By this point, I was the President of the Marching Band and had a group of people I was friendly with who respected me as a musician and young leader. One of the band Moms found my LiveJournal and turned it into the school. I've always questioned if she did it because she genuinely wanted to help me, or if it was because her son was one of my rivals.

In whichever case, it was both one of the most traumatic things that ever happened to me and probably also one of the best. While everything I wrote was my protected by the first amendment and fully my right to do, this was the early days of the internet, shortly after Columbine and the school reacted very harshly. I was kicked out of marching band immediately and made to feel like some kid who was going to shoot up the school, rather than a hurting lost adolescent. 

The result of this rude awakening was that I went from being a C/D student to being a straight A student. All the way through high school and college. I became determined to show them that I was not a bad kid. My new identity was guided by the principle of *the best revenge is success*. 

> It's always bothered me that the school administrators got away with treating me the way they did. If something like this happened today, it would be a national scandal on the news. But this was the early 2000s and things were different.
> 
> Despite the trauma of it all, this was a defining moment in my life. And it defined me for the better.

## Cornerstone & Praying Away the Gay
Summer of 2003, the summer between Middle School and High School, I finally took a stand with my Mom and refused to go to her fundamentalist church anymore. I found this new church called Cornerstone Church of San Diego, at that point meeting at a high school in the city I live. 

If the church I grew up in was akin to a homeless shelter, this new church was the Ritz Carlton, despite meeting in a high school. It was so flashy, happy and positive. It had all of the things that I wished my childhood church had had. But most of all, it was a new start. No one there knew me. I could decide what my future would be. I could reinvent myself and go into high school as a new iteration of myself.

I got involved immediately. I helped setup and breakdown the church on Sundays. I got involved in the youth ministry and helped with that. I spent my whole summer interning at the church, helping with their website and marketing. And I met one of my best friends who is still my best friend to this day.

But, I had a secret still. A secret that was eating away at me. I was gay. And being gay is against god. So I went to a couple of guys who mentored me for help. They sympathized, but ultimately were not able to help me *pray away the gay*. (As an interesting aside, one of the guys who helped me *pray away the gay* is now an out and proud gay man too).

It eventually got back to the youth pastor who told the senior pastor and they removed me from everything I was involved in. They told me that they loved me, but they just couldn't have me in positions of leadership until I handled my little *problem*. 

I didn't take it sitting down this time. I left the church and never looked back. At this point I hadn't even kissed someone of the same sex, so to be punished after putting in so much work for what essentially amounted to *thought crime* was not something I was going to put up with.

# High School
After the Cornerstone drama, I went to high school. And I was successful in high school socially. I got involved in clubs, sports and the student newspaper. I even got involved in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, a very moderate and accepting Christian organization who helped me accept myself. And accept that God still loved me, even if I didn't fit into the little box that some churches say.

But unfortunately that wasn't enough to keep me around, after a couple of years I still felt like I was living a lie. I wasn't able to reconcile religion and being gay. I left the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, started the decent to godlessness and never looked back.

To this day, I am a proud Agnostic and one who absolutely believes that humans can be good without god. Most of the best and most giving people I know aren't religious, in fact. 

## Workaholism as Escapism
Looking back, High School was when my alcoholic traits first began to manifest. Despite standing up and living my truth, I still felt broken inside. But I learned how to escape. I just stayed so busy I didn't have time to think or feel. 

I did honors classes, AP classes, community college classes in the evening, worked in the summer, was involved in clubs and sports, volunteered at an animal rescue and served as the newspaper editor.

This got me through high school without ever having to really look inside.

## Coming Out
I began to come out to close friends at the end of eighth grade, but I finally came out publicly my junior year of high school. Except no one really cared one way or the other. 

But it made me feel better about myself to take charge of my own identity and to be who I am. Unfortunately this didn't go over well with my fundamentalist Christian Mom. In fact, she didn't come around and become an ally until I was around 25.

## Overachievement as Self-Worth
My relationship with my Dad never recovered. To this day we don't get along well. I love him, but I can't stand to be around him for longer than a couple days. My Dad beat me down a lot as a kid. Particularly concerning my weight and body image, which also never recovered. (Although it's gotten better in recovery.)

These issues made me feel like shit inside. But there was one area of my life where I was better than everyone else I knew: academic achievement. I consistently scored as the top of my class, graduated high school with 20 college credits and got into all 12 of the Universities that I applied to.

On the surface, these things - these pats on the back and ego strokes - made me feel a little less miserable. But inside I still hated myself. But if I stayed busy I didn't have time to think about it.

# Adulthood
Despite all of my college acceptances, I decided to stay home and go to school here in San Diego. I also decided to work full time to help support that. By this point in my life, my Mom had gotten a super good job and we were no longer poor. But, then, and still to this day, I live with a very frugal mindset.

## Working for "The Man"
My senior year of high school I had a job working at a grocery store. It was good experience, but standing on my feet behind a deli counter 8 hours a day didn't really appeal to me, so I sought another job. I got hired as a bookkeeper at a real estate company. And over time became their field services person. That job lasted a couple of years, until I got a job as assistant manager at a Starbucks. 

This was my first adult job where I was around other gay people. And it was the first time I started to feel comfortable in my skin with who I was. A couple of jobs later, I worked for Apple. Apple had tons of LGBT employees and didn't treat them any differently. It wasn't until this point in my life that I would consider myself *out and proud*, despite both of my parents refusing to accept me.

## Entrepreneurism
In 2011, I decided to study abroad to Vietnam. I didn't want to do Europe like everyone else. In retrospect this was a poor choice, but it was one of the stepping stones which got me to where I am today, so I don't regret it.

Apple wouldn't give me more than one month off of work, so I had to quit my job. This was one of the scariest things I ever did, but I had about $1000 in Apple stock which I was able to live off of.

When I got back from Vietnam, this forced me to hustle to make money. I began as an IT consultant who helped people fix their computers and evolved into a web developer. After a while, I became a web developer full time.

With the help of BNI, the GSDBA and other networking organizations in San Diego, I was shaped and evolved into the business person that I am today.

The GSDBA was an LGBT Business Association that existed in San Diego in the early 2010s. This organization helped me to network with other high performing LGBT San Diegans and find my voice. Not only did I become a better business person as a result of my involvement, but I became a better person. I learned to love and accept myself. And to let other LGBT people love me and nurture me professionally. Before this point my life was still largely ruled by internalized homophobia. 

## Descent into Addiction
Being self-employed as a great thing. I worked full time for myself through the rest of University. And once I graduated, I had a good foundation to begin building my business. 

Unfortunately, I no longer had workaholism as an escape. Without school to keep my mind occupied, I had a lot of time to think. And this led me to start drinking a lot more. First a couple beers a week, eventually 6 beers a day with a weekly binge or two. 

I began to put on weight. I began to have other health warning signs like pre-diabetes and high liver enzymes. But none of these things were enough for me to quit drinking. 

## Ignoring Warning Signs
I was doing a hair loss study in 2015 for male pattern baldness. As part of the study, they take a bunch of labs before you use their experimental hair loss drug and then a bunch of labs after to see if anything has changed. All of their labs, both before and after the experimental drug showed very high liver enzymes. Like hepatitis levels of elevated liver enzymes. 

Both the doctor and the nurse talked to me about quitting drinking. And I was scared for a couple of days. But then I went right back to being a daily drinker. As if nothing happened.

I was told by a doctor that it looks like I have hepatitis from my drinking, but my addiction was so strong that not even that could get through to me. In AA that's referred to as alcoholic insanity.

## Dating & Internalized Homophobia

Another thing that alcohol helped me with, especially in early adulthood, was dating and intimacy with men. Because of my upbringing, there was a lot of internalized homophobia. I knew I was gay, I was out, I was dating men, but I was still very repressed in a lot of ways. Kissing a man or having sex with a man required alcohol to let my guard down. 

The first time I had sex without some kind of substance involved was at age 26. And it was weird. Freeing also, but weird to be fully present.
