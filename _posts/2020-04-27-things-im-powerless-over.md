My assignment from my sponsor for our 2nd meeting is to list the things I'm powerless over. Which I can sum up as:

> I'm powerless over all persons, places and things other than myself.

I *can* control many things about myself, in my own life. But one thing I'm powerless over is alcohol after the first drink. As long as I stay away from that first drink, I'm not powerless over alcohol though.

Other things I'm powerless over, in no particular order:
- What people think of me
- What people say about me
- If people like me or not
- If people find me attractive or not
- Not *fitting in*
- The health of my loved ones (impermanence)
- The economy

The list could go on infinitely, but I wanted to list the things that I've drank over.
