I’ve known since college Buddhist Philosophy class that meditation and mindfulness is the way to go. That meditation is the way to end the suffering. But until recently I’ve never actually worked on developing a spiritual practice.

I bought this book like 5 years ago. And I’m just now reading. As if buying a bunch of books - but not reading them - will somehow change my life by osmosis.

Today I’m learning in much more detail about the connection of the body-mind complex. How the body cannot function without the mind and the mind cannot function without the body.

At any rate, it’s time to put my money where my mouth is. And commit to 20 minutes of meditation per day.
