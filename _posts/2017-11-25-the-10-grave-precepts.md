My friend and I went to Temple last night. It was a pretty cool place to be on a Friday night. Who would have ever thought I'd be at "church" on a Friday rather than out drinking?

One of the things I discussed with a guy after the meeting was the Lay Precepts. And I wanted to list these just for my own reflection.
<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Respect life – Do not kill</li>
 	<li>Be giving – Do not steal</li>
 	<li>Honor the body – Do not misuse sexuality</li>
 	<li>Manifest truth – Do not lie</li>
 	<li>Proceed clearly – Do not cloud the mind</li>
 	<li>See the perfection – Do not speak of others' errors and faults</li>
 	<li>Realize self and other as one – Do not elevate the self and blame others</li>
 	<li>Give generously – Do not be withholding</li>
 	<li>Actualize harmony – Do not be angry</li>
 	<li>Experience the intimacy of things – Do not defile the Three Treasures</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>I especially need to focus on "see the perfection". I don't want to talk smack about anyone. It's a bad habit that has followed at least 3 generations of my family. And it's time to break it.
