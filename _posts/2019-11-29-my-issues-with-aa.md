As no human is perfect, no program or organization is perfect either. As AA likes to say, recovery is about *progress, not perfection*. Which is a philosophy that I try to live my life by. 

However, despite the catchy one liner, AA isn't striving for progress, it is based on a dogma from the 1920s and has changed little since it was developed. If AA doesn't work for someone, it is that person's fault. Either they weren't working their program good enough, they haven't hit a low enough bottom, they aren't *willing to go to any lengths to get sober* or some equivalent means of gaslighting. Since AA is a spiritual program, any suggestion that it is imperfect might as well be suggesting that God herself is imperfect. Absolute taboo.

Another issue with AA? 12 Step Programs almost always fail[^fn1]. There is very little research to the efficacy of 12 step methods and the research which does exist doesn't cast AA in a kind light.

In this blog I am going to discuss some of the key issues I have with AA, which eventually caused me to leave the fellowship. Some of these reasons will be backed with evidence (cited at the end of this blog) and the rest will be my personal opinion.

> ## Disclaimer
> This is one man's opinion on Alcoholics Anonymous. If you are suffering from addiction and getting help from a 12 Step Program, continue doing what works for you. This is in no way meant to encourage anyone else to discontinue their own program if it's working. I simply got to a point where it was no longer working for me.

## 1. Reliance On A Higher Power
Alcoholics Anonymous is a spiritual program, meaning that you are said to *recover* from addiction through a spiritual experience. In *Alcoholics Anonymous* ("The Big Book"), the source literature of AA, the founder Bill Wilson talks about situations where people had a *bright white light* radical awakening sort of spiritual experience. But goes on to assert that many other people can have a more gradual spiritual experience through working the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.

While the language of *The Big Book* is very Judeo-Christian in nature, with phrases such as *either God is everything or else He is nothing. God either is, or He isn't.*[^fn2], it is nonetheless insisted by 12 steppers that one's higher power can be anything. It can be a door knob, it can be AA itself, or I've even heard of one lady using her cat as her higher power. The only important part is that it must be a power other than yourself.

I really struggled with this idea. If it's supposed to be a spiritual experience, some entity that I am praying to, how exactly is my cat or a doorknob going to help me out? As an atheist, with a lot of baggage from being raised as a fundamentalist Christian, I really struggled with this concept. 

I finally decided to just *go with it* because my first sponsor was getting frustrated with me. So I chose *the spirit of the universe* or *source energy* as my higher power. It didn't actually mean anything to me, I didn't feel any connection with said higher power, but it appeased my sponsor.

As things progressed, I never did feel a connection with my higher power and I eventually stopped praying at all. Prayer, to me, was simply saying words out loud, to no one. And seemed pointless. So I focused my energy on meditation which was actually very beneficial.

Apparently I am not alone, when it comes to this. 

> A clear and consistent pattern of endorsement was evident . . . with the majority agreeing with steps that do not explicitly mention God or a Higher Power but encourage acceptance, self-examination and reparation (grouped as “Personal Responsibility” steps). A considerable proportion reported the references to God (54.4%) and the Higher Power (62.4%) were “off-putting” (the term most commonly used in pilot interviews for adverse views).[^fn3]

The same Harris study referenced above concluded that *of patients with AA experience...[only] 2.8% had experienced a spiritual awakening*, which isn't very encouraging in a program that is specifically relies on spirituality as its basis.

Most of the people I associated with in AA, many of them true believers, paid lip service to their higher power doing things in their life, but never with much conviction. With only a few exceptions, I never saw much evidence of any of them having a spiritual practice or any kind of *relationship* with a higher power, at least not in the Judeo-Christian sense.

## 2. Mean, Entitled *Old Timers* & Creepy *SoBros*
When I went to AA, I assumed because of the Judeo-Christian vibe, that people were generally trying to better themselves. That they wanted to be good, healthy, socially acceptable people in every aspect of their lives, not just in regards to their consumption of alcohol.

That is, after all, what I was trying to do myself. To continue to grow and evolve as a person. To strive for self-actualization. While I'm sure there are many other people in the same boat as me, overall that was not my experience in AA.

I've encountered more awful, cruel, bullying people in AA than I have anywhere else in my life. It was like the primary school play yard, without any adult supervision, with the bullies running the show.

And if you dare speak up, you're the one with the issue. Through a variety of gaslighting, the behavior is justified and you are criticized in one of the following ways:

- *We don't take others' inventory* or their behavior isn't anyone elses business but theirs and should not be questioned (more about this in #3 below)
- You're newly sober, you don't know anything about anything, just shut up and do what we tell you
- Or, my favorite, *AA is full of sick people*, just pray for them (my first sponsor phrased it as *it's not called 'well people's anonymous'*)

But there was never personal accountability. Or even a general agreement that the behavior is inappropriate. Just a collective shrug.

The following are some of my most notable experiences with this absolute abhorrent behavior:

### *The Thread*
More than any other experience in AA, *The Thread* takes the prize as one of the most reprehensible things I've witnessed. In essence, it is a group chat (iMessage) of a bunch of the young-ish single white dudes in AA. The kind of men who would be frat boys doing kegstands and date-raping women, if they were still out drinking. 

While it was a mix of straight and gay men, the majority were straight men, toxicly masculine straight men, who treat women awfully, and yet wonder why they can't get laid. 

*The thread* is a cesspool of comments, conversations, images, memes and other inappropriate things that have no place in civilized society - but in cyberspace make their participants feel safe. The guy who started *the thread* is actually somewhat well known in San Diego - he works for the local newspaper and regularly appears on tv. Somehow I can't imagine human resources would be very happy with him if they ever caught wind of the things that he encourages in *the thread*.

**Things I've witnessed**
- Extreme bullying (more about this below)
- Straight men sending dick pics to each other (to the delight of the few gay participants)
- Objectification of women
- Photoshopping each others faces onto gay porn pics
- Racism & white nationalist themes

And just general chaos. The side kick of the founder of *the thread* is constantly in and out of the mental hospital because he frequently tries to kill himself. And when he's in the thread he adds people and kicks people at random - many people who do not want to be a part of the thread and have asked many times not to be added - get added anyway. And then have to leave. And then the regulars talk shit about them.

Especially in the beginning of my time in AA, I had very conflicting feelings about the thread. On the one hand I thought it was completely disgusting, on the other hand these were the *cool kids* in AA and I wanted to feel accepted and part of the group. Ultimately I was rejected.

Another disappointing thing about *the thread* is that many of these men are thought of as leaders in AA: young, attractive, cool people who have their lives together after multiple years of sobriety. Mentors who take on new guys as sponsees and help them get their shit together. These newly sober guys, looking up to their sponsors, perhaps without much of a moral compass of their own, see this behavior and think it is acceptable. **It's not.**

### Extreme bullying

Having been bullied myself in primary school, I've always considered myself as a champion of the underdog. I hate bullying. Especially adult bullying in the workplace. 

Along with my expectation of people pursuing general *goodness* in AA, I didn't expect to find pervasive bullying. But find it I did. The group from *The Thread* who calls themselves the *Samurai Wolf Squadron* regularly bullied. And if someone got upset about the bullying - either the victim, or someone else - queue the gaslighting. 

- They are too sensitive and need to toughen up.
- This is all in good fun.
- This is how men socialize.

Their most notable victim was a guy called Matt. Matt is a little different to say the least. Perhaps even on the autism spectrum. But overall a nice and caring guy. Like me in the beginning, he wanted to be accepted by this group. He wanted to belong and feel like one of the cool kids. And for a time, they appeared to accept him. But the whole time they were talking shit about him and belittling him.

Through *The Thread*, they would make cruel memes with his face photoshopped onto them. He changed his phone number multiple times, changed the meetings he want to, and completely changed his social group. And still the abuse continued.

The guy who brought me into AA in the first place, Danny, who I have tremendous respect for otherwise, justifies these attacks on Matt as acceptable because he doesn't approve of how Matt dresses. Or because Matt doesn't have a car and asks people for rides. Or because Matt doesn't take his advice when it comes to courting women.

It is acceptable to bully this person - with what is probably criminal harassment - because this person doesn't live in a way which the oppressor deems appropriate. In fact, it is the victim's own fault that he is being bullied.

Most recently, someone who loosely is associated with the Samurai Wolf group, who Matt considered a friend, got Matt's new phone number, in confidence, promising not to share it with anyone. And promptly shared it with *The Thread*, which almost immediately began the harassment and bullying again. Needless to say, Matt was devastated. He felt alone, isolated and very depressed by how these people treated him. People who were supposed to be his bros or *SoBros*.

These are the guys who are supposed to have it together. These are the guys who are mentoring other men, to help *them* get it together. Behaving like petulant children, in the school yard.

### Grown men throwing tantrums

One of the marks of adulthood is having control of one's emotions. Some, like my father, never quite get it down. But most of us do. And in a program of self-improvement, I expected the *old timers* to display basic adult behavior. 

**Not so in AA.**

According to Tradition 2 of the *12 Traditions* of AA, which are the guiding principles, it says `For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.` In other words, there are no leaders. There are people who take on commitments to help meetings happen, but everything is supposed to be decided by democratic means, or *group conscience*. 

To do this, many meetings have what is called a *business meeting*, generally once per month. The business meeting is made up of the people who hold a commitment in that meeting and then anyone else who decides to stay after. But it's not required unless you want to stay. This allows meetings to focus on the purpose of AA, helping alcoholics, and saves the politics like *arguing for 35 mins about a coffee maker* for afterward.

The original Monday Night Men's Meeting that I went to had a business meeting, immediately after the main meeting, once per month. And politically speaking, the room was divided into two factions. Acolytes of Matt G., the leader of the *Samurai Wolf Squadron* and Big Don, the self-appointed patriarch of this meeting. I was later to find out that Big Don was Matt G's sponsor at one point, making the feud all the more interesting. 

The business meetings were usually a big debate over nothing and rather pointless in my view, but still considered a best practice for a healthy meeting. 6 months into my AA experience, Big Don decided that the meeting should no longer have a business meeting, because he is a new Dad of twins and doesn't want to stay for the business meeting anymore. So he called for a snap vote at the end of a regular meeting and his tribe outnumbered the Samurai Wolf guys, causing the room to side with Don. *Goodbye business meeting*. 

Shortly thereafter, the Samurai Wolf guys left the meeting. Basically the whole left side of the room. They started a new meeting in Matt G's living room. Don had won, but at what cost?

Fast forward a couple of months, now that there was no more business meeting, group business had to be dealt with during the normal meeting. Big Don, like the patriarch he saw himself, would arrive late to the meeting, and sit on the chair that one of his acolytes saved for him in the back of the room. Like a king. On two separate occasions, I witnessed him throwing a complete tantrum, when he wanted his way on something. 

Mind you, this guy has 30+ years of sobriety, is a high school principal, has the husband, two designer babies and the million dollar house with the white picket fence. And has even sponsored many of the men in that room. But he's still throwing tantrums like his 2 year old children do.

This is supposed to be a leader, both in and out of the rooms. A man who is supposed to have achieved all of the *promises* of sobriety, behaving like a toddler. It pains me to think about how these spectacles must look to newcomers, trying to get sober, perhaps in the room for the first time.

### Publicly embarrassing new members

This is more the exception than the norm, but is still something I've witnessed, particularly at my Monday Night Men's Meeting which was a fairly large meeting (up to 100 people, average around 60).

One notable instance was a new guy, who was attending an AA meeting despite suffering from some issue other than alcohol. When he got up, he introduced himself as an addict rather than an alcoholic. 

To me, addiction is addiction. Alcoholic, drug addict, sex addict, compulsive eater - it's all the same thing. Who cares what language he uses? But one of the *old timers* in the meeting disagreed. Despite a *no cross-talk* rule, he interrupted the visibly nervous guy, by shouting at him, in front of the whole room and asking him if he wants to get better. He said yes. So the *old timer* said *then you are an alcoholic. Say you are an alcoholic, not an addict, this isn't NA*.

Definitely not the best approach if you're trying to reach someone who is hurting.

Another notable experience was Big Don putting my sponsee John on the spot, publicly, in front of the whole room, after a relapse. John had recently relapsed and come back to AA immediately after the relapse. As is standard, at the beginning of the meeting they ask everyone who has less than 30 days of continuous sobriety.  John had to stand up again after taking a 30 day token, which is definitely embarrassing. It says to the whole room that someone has relapsed. In AA, relapse is a moral failure on the part of the relapsee. And it is taboo, rather than a natural consequence of alcoholism, meaning someone needs some extra loving. 

Anyway, at the end of the meeting, the facilitator said that they need a new backup coffee making person. Someone who can fill in when the main guy can't make it. Because having a commitment at a meeting is generally accepted as a best practice, I raised my hand and pointed to my sponsee John, volunteering him. I wanted him to have some service commitment and to get better socially integrated.

Big Don stood up at the back of the room, shouting over everyone, asking John how long he has been sober. We ignored him. He asked again. The room shuffled uncomfortable, but again we ignored him. Finally, when he asked the third time, John said like a week. Big Don said that we need someone with more sobriety to make coffee. He then went on to say that the coffee maker has a key to the room (they don't) and that we just couldn't trust someone with a recent relapse to make coffee (as the backup coffee person, mind you). The facilitator then went on to basically force me to be John's guarantor - the backup to the backup - in case he isn't reliable.

This whole experience completely turned me off, not least of all because these *old timers* such as Big Don have so many opinions about how things *ought to be done*, but haven't, themselves, lifted a finger in years. And, as evidenced by his comment about the coffee person having a key, he didn't even have any idea what he was talking about.

### 13th stepping

Lets be honest - gay, straight, or somewhere in between - men are nasty. We just are. But most of us learn by our 20s the appropriate level of nastiness we can get away with in civilized society. That boundary doesn't exist in AA. And as I've discussed above, it is full of frat boy types looking to get laid. And creepy predatory men in general.

There is a popular phrase in AA called *13th Stepping*, a play on the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. 13th Stepping means to have sex with someone in the program, specifically someone who is new and/or vulnerable. 

In other words, any woman looking for a safe space in early recovery, should stick to women's meetings. Because she is going to be a sex object to the men in AA. When there is a new woman in recovery, they are pounced on by all of the horny *SoBros*.

The same can be said of young, attractive, especially *white*, young gay men. By the other gays in AA. They get pounced on and 13th stepped, at their most vulnerable. But that's kinda how gay culture is in general. There isn't generally a sexual gatekeeper like there is in heterosexual situations. So I think the women are in the more vulnerable position overall.

## 3. *We Don't Take Others Inventory* And A General Rejection of Personal Accountability

One of the most valuable parts of 12 step recovery for me was step 4: taking inventory of my life, specifically taking inventory of resentments, fears, and sexual baggage. More than anything else, this helped me to throw out the emotional garbage and turn a new page in my recovery. I think this process is highly valuable for everyone, even people without issues with addiction or compulsive behavior.

A general rule of thumb in AA is that *we don't take others' inventory* which is great in theory. We need to focus on keeping our own side of the street clean and not worry about others. Or be judgmental.

But in practice, this turns into a complete disregard of any personal accountability for ones' actions. It is the ultimate gaslighting: being able to turn any criticism of one's behavior back on the person speaking up. If someone does something wrong and you call them out? *We don't take others inventory*. Despite the general zero sum, black and white morality of AA, this defense can be used to make any action some shade of gray. And justify it.

If nothing else, the defense goes something along the lines of *I am an alcoholic and sick* so whatever I do is therefore okay. And if not okay, then something that is my business alone and certainly not yours.

I've seen this logic applied to:

- Being consistently late
- Not returning calls and/or texts
- Cheating on one's spouse
- Practicing unsafe sexual behavior (with and without the presence of STIs)
- Bullying (see above)
- Treating women like garbage
- Using homeless people as props in pictures for self-promotion on instagram

That said, I realize it's not my job to be these peoples conscience. I have enough of my own issues to worry about and fix. But the complete disregard of any personal accountability for anything baffled me. Especially in a program that claims to be a self-help program based upon spiritual principles. 

It's also quite striking that AA is so black and white about some things - like a small sip of alcohol after 20 years starts you back at square one in terms of sobriety - but 13th stepping someone knowing you have HIV, or bullying someone so bad that they have to change their phone number, is *we don't take others inventory*.
